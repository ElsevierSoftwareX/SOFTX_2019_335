Part2Track
Matlab programm to perform two-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry
(2D-PTV) on double-frame images and time-resolved image sequences.                 

## Acquisition Modes
* Double-Frame
* Time-Resolved

## Methods
* Nearest Neighbour Search
* Histogram Matching
* Four-Frame Tracking
* Universal Outlier Detection

## Post-Processing
* Interpolation of scattered data onto regular grid
	* Gaussian-weighted bin averaging
	* Polynomial bin fit
* Ensemble averaging
* Vortex detection
* POD reconstruction
* ...
